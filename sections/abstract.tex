\begin{document}
    Basic properties of simplicial and cyclic sets and the geometric realization of the respective are studied. This is conducted using a category theoretical approach when reasonable and a more direct algebraic topological such when simpler.  As the topics are uncommon on an undergraduate level an introduction of topological, category theoretic and simplicial notions and concepts will be included. The purpose is the understanding of the aforementioned and further exploration into the supposedly less traversed of cyclic sets.
