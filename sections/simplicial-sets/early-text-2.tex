    In this chapter a composition of the aforementioned theory will lead to defining simplicial sets and cyclic sets. In combination with the ubiquitous category formalization a more historic and hopefully more intuitive approach will be included of the definition. Following that a treatise of the geometric realization of the sets, a functor to topological spaces, will integrate and motivate the theory of the prior chapter.
